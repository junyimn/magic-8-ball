A super small project creating a tradtional magic 8 ball machine which will answer your question with a form of yes, no, maybe or try again. The magic 8 ball does not actually  store the question or take the question into consideration, it's simply there to simulate entering a questions. The answer will be randomized using the java.util.Random import, and will return answers which are put into a 'if else' statements.

<ul>
            <li>As i see it yes.</li>
       <li>Signs point to yes.</li>
            <li>Don't count on it.</li>
     <li>Reply hazy, please try again>/li>
      <li>Outlook not so good.
       
            <li>HELL YEAH!</li>
       
            <li>HELL NO!</li>
        
            <li>With a little bit more persistence, yes!</li>
