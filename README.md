# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

A super small project creating a tradtional magic 8 ball machine which will answer your question with a form of yes, no, maybe or try again. The magic 8 ball does not actually  store the question or take the question into consideration, it's simply there to simulate entering a questions. The answer will be randomized using the java.util.Random import, and will return answers which are put into a 'if else' statements.

Answers include:

if(rand == 0) {
            System.out.println("As i see it yes.");
        } else if (rand == 1) {
            System.out.println("Signs point to yes.");
        } else if (rand == 2) {
            System.out.println("Don't count on it.");
        } else if (rand == 3) {
            System.out.println("Reply hazy, please try again");
        } else if (rand == 4) {
            System.out.println("Outlook not so good.");
        }  else if (rand == 5) {
        System.out.println("HELL YEAH!");
        } else if (rand == 6) {
            System.out.println("HELL NO!");
        } else if (rand == 7) {
            System.out.println("With a little bit more persistence, yes!");
        }
